I just found out that the sort I was working on is BINARY INSERTION SORT.
I just thought of the name Binary since that's how the sort works and I knew it was similar to insertion sort. 
I still couldn't put two and two together. Someone on SO helped me with that.

That's my pep talk for today. Have a good day!
